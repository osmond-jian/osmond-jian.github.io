This page has been updated to React, with a better design and colour scheme. The .github/workflows/main.yml contains instructions for github pages to build and deploy the app.

This site uses Vite, Tailwind, and React to render and style the pages. It also uses google ReCaptcha to validate the form, and EmailJS to send the form message to my email.
